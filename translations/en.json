And that's how I came to Enduranc3, a place where passion for sports meets science and professional knowledge. Here I found not only a team, but a family that shares the same values and goals. The path hasn't always been easy, but with dedication, effort and the right support, any goal is achievable. Every training session, every competition, every day is an opportunity to grow and surpass ourselves."

				"content": "Why did we create Enduranc3? Since I was very young, sports have been my main hobby and inspiration and I was very clear that my professional future and my passion should be closely related. The idea of being able to help other athletes achieve their goals while living my passion daily was something I had always dreamed of. At Enduranc3 we found the perfect way to combine sports science with the personal and professional treatment that every athlete deserves. We firmly believe that training should be individualized, based on objective data and always with a human approach. Every athlete is unique, and their planning should reflect that."

				"content": "If you've made it here, I suppose it's because you want to know something more about me, but first I want to ask you a question: what is sports to you? For me, sports is much more than competing or training. It's a way of life, a tool for personal growth, a way to know oneself and overcome limits we thought were impossible. Sports has taught me values such as discipline, perseverance, teamwork and humility. At Enduranc3, we work every day to transmit these values and help our athletes not only improve their performance, but grow as people. Because in the end, sports is a journey of self-knowledge and constant improvement."
